# TodoList_php

Simple todolist where you can :

*   create / update / delete an account
*   create / update / delete todos
*   create / delete / categories for todos
*   sort and pin todos

##Â WARNING 

I know that there is so many weird things in my code :') i'm using this project as a sandbox
I'll soon organise files && separate the php code from the html.

## Stack :

*   html / css
*   Php
*   MySQL
*   Js

### Setup

*   Clone this project with `git@github.com:SacleuxBenoit/TodoList_php.git`

*   Create a file `login_database.php` at the root of the project with `<?php $_SESSION['pass'] = 'root'?>` in it. For MAMP the default password is `root` and for WAMP there's no password `''`.
